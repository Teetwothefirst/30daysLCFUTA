# 30daysLCFUTA
I joined the 30 days learning challenge hosted by GDSC_FUTA. I'm working on Front-end

Challenge:
    Build Your own custom cheat sheet

Day2: clone the CROP Project website 
I made a desktop view of the crop project which is a website that sells U.S Grown atlantic kelp to individual, organizations, government and agencies that can apply these incredible plant in food, medicine and vitamins. 
	Cloning the project using html and css, it was built majorly on the box models and the flexbox attributes that helps to size and resize the properties of different object in the website
	After creating the skeleton of the website using the HTML and ensuring all the needed contents are well arranged from top to bottom, a link is initiated with the css file thereby linking both the html and css files to allow for direct editing, styling and designing of the webpage.
